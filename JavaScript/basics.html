<h3>Chapter One</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        let is a keyword that we use to create a new variable.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is then followed by the name of the variable.
    </li>
    <li>
        Then followed by the equal sign = which assigns it (or gives it a value)
    </li>
    <li>
        Then followed by the value of the variable.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Make sure to give descriptive names for your variables.
</p>

<h3>Chapter Two</h3>
<p>
    The + operator adds the 2 numbers on its left and right
</p>
<p>
    The * operator multiplies the 2 numbers on its left and right
</p>

<p>
    A function is a reusable piece of code that performs some logic and gives you a result
</p>
<p>
    The return keyword allows the function to give the result of its computation.
</p>
<p>
    return keyword can only be used inside a function.
</p>

<h3>Chapter Three</h3>
<p>
    A function is a reusable piece of code that performs some logic and gives you a result
</p>
<p>
    The return keyword allows the function to give the result of its computation.
</p>
<p>
    return keyword can only be used inside a function.
</p>
<p>
    A parameter is a variable that a function receives.
</p>
<p>
    Most functions will use that variable they receive and will compute the result based on it.
</p>
<p>
    To call a function, you have to start with its name then opening parentheses (, then the value you want to give to the parameter and then a closing parenthesis )
</p>

<h3>Chapter Four</h3>
<p>
    Functions can have multiple parameters, they should be separated by a comma (and a space for readability)
</p>
<p>
    The argument is a value passed to a function. The argument becomes the parameter for that specific function call.
</p>
<p>
    The parameters of a function are only accessible inside that function. (This concept is called variable scope)
</p>
<p>
    You can store/save the result of a function in a variable.
</p>

<h3>Project One</h3>
<h4>Calculator</h4>

<p>
    Define a variable. Example: let year = 2020
</p>
<p>
    Use an existing variable. Example: year (assuming it was already defined)
</p>
<p>
    Use functions to reuse logic in your code. Example the function sum that we defined
</p>
<p>
    Using return inside a function which represents the result of the function
</p>
<p>
    Using the following operators to do mathematical computations: + - * /
</p>
<p>
    + (add), * (multiply), - (subtract), / (divide)
</p>

<h3>Intro into Strings</h3>
<h4>Chapter One</h4>
<p>
    A string is a text, a set of characters that you may write to represent a name, city, country, description, product title, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Strings have to start with a double quote " and end with one.
</p>
<p>
    Forgetting the double quotes around strings is the most common mistake that beginners make.
</p>
<p>
    .length is a property of strings that returns the number of characters in a string.
</p>

<h3>Chapter Two</h3>
<p>
    console.log() allows you to visualize your code in the console.
</p>
<p>
    The console is only visible to you (the developer), but not the end-user.
</p>
<p>
    console.log() helps you find bugs, does NOT replace return, and will never modify the result of a function, it will just show you a string or a number in the Console.
</p>
<p>
    Sample usage is meant to show you examples of how your functions will be called.
</p>
<p>
    We will often console.log the sample usage so that you can see its values in the console.
</p>
<p>
    Beware of hardcoding - the sample usage is only meant as an example.
</p>

<h3>Chapter Three</h3>
<p>
    The .toUpperCase() method makes a new copy of a string while converting every single character into uppercase.
</p>
<p>
    The .toLowerCase() method creates a copy of the string that is all in lower case.
</p>
<p>
    Pay attention to the way those methods are called: .toUpperCase() with a capital U and capital C. Same for .toLowerCase() with a capital L and capital C.
</p>
<p>
    The () at the end of the method are required.
</p>

<h3>Project Two</h3>
<h4>Name Variations</h4>

/** @param {string} name */
export function getNumberOfChars(name) {
// return the number of characters in: name
return name.length
}


/** @param {string} name */
export function getLower(name) {
// return name all in lower case (example: "ABC" becomes "abc")
return name.toLowerCase()
}

/** @param {string} name */
export function getUpper(name) {
// return name all in upper case (example: "abc" becomes "ABC")
return name.toUpperCase()
}
