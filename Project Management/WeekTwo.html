    A successful project manager sees the impacts of each process within the project and communicates those impacts to the team.

    <li>
        This ensures that everyone working on the project understands their task goal as well as the big picture goal for the finished product.
    </li>
<li>
    Helping team members understand the big picture allows them to tailor their tasks to meet the needs of the project end goal.
</li>

    You can provide support for your team as they try new approaches to find solutions, and you can advocate for additional resources for your team.

<h2>Key project manager roles and responsibilities</h2>

<p>
    One responsibility that falls under the umbrella of planning and organizing is making<strong> use of productivity tools and creating processes</strong>.
</p>
    <p>
        During the planning and execution of a project, you might need to use certain tools and develop processes to improve information sharing across the team; you may also need to create plans, timelines, schedules, and other forms of documentation to track project completion, and you'll usually need to maintain those documents throughout the entirety of the project.
    </p>

<p>
<h3>budgeting and controlling costs</h3>
<p>
    monitor and manage the budget, track issues and risks as they arise, and manage quality by mitigating those issues and risks.
</p>
<p>
    removing unforeseen barriers that come up
</p>
    <p>
        if your teammates lack the resources needed to complete a task, you might identify that issue, or barrier upfront, escalate the issue to a stakeholder, and work to secure the resource so your team can move forward.
    </p>
<h3>Keeping track of tasks</h3>

<p>demonstrating progress</p>

</p>

<h2>Responsibilities that utilize interpersonal skills </h2>

<h3>Teaching and mentoring</h3>
<p>
    When you take the time to fully explain the expectations, you eliminate rework, confusion, and frustration.
</p>
    <p>
        allows your team to make better choices and build on your experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mentoring also involves supporting each individual on your team in meeting expectations and helping them to exceed their own sense of personal potential.
    </p>

<h3>Building relationships</h3>
<p>Dedicate time to check in with people.</p>
<p>
    Pay attention to the insights they offer you about their work style since their actions can inform how to most effectively interact with them.
</p>

<h3>Controlling change</h3>
<p>
    Projects change as you continue to understand the expectations and the needs of your stakeholders.
</p>
    <p>you need to remain flexible and adjust</p>
    <p>
        also important to protect your team from constant change and rework
    </p>
    <p>
        A good way to do this is by documenting the initial expectations of the project and clearly identifying the changes being requested
    </p>
    <p>
        It is also helpful to understand the budget and schedule impact of the changes and make sure that the stakeholders understand those impacts.
    </p>

<h3>Empowering your team</h3>
<p>
    One of the best things about empowering your team is getting fresh ideas and passionate employees willing to help find solutions to problems.
</p>
<p>
    Another way you can empower your team is by delegating responsibilities to them, allowing them to make some decisions for the project, and using their input in the planning and execution of the project
</p>

<h3>Communicating status and concerns</h3>
<p>
    Maintaining an open door policy and building trust within your team and among stakeholders—all while staying positive—will help the success of the project.
</p>

<h2>Project Manager role within team</h2>

<p>
    Everyone on your team will have their own set of roles and responsibilities.
</p>
<p>
    You'll come together to ensure that everyone is able to do their part to advance the project.
</p>
<p>
    Each person will be an expert on their portion of the project, but no one will be an expert on every aspect of the project
</p>
<p>
    As the project manager, you won't be an expert in every project role, and that's okay.
</p>

    <p>
        Instead you're responsible for guiding your team and making sure that they have the support that they need in order to complete the project.
    </p>

<ul>
<li>
    1. you'll need to hold all team members accountable for their assigned tasks.
</li>
    <li>
        a. Managing tasks will help you hold your team members accountable by giving them ownership over specific pieces of the project.
    </li>
<li>
    2. you'll need to ensure that issues and risks are tracked and visible, and be able to establish escalation paths.
</li>
<li>
   a. Now by escalation paths, I mean that you should know how you will communicate risks to the right people at the right time.
</li>
<li>
    3. you'll need to understand and help teammates adopt the right workflows and project management styles.
</li>

<li>
    a. As the project manager, you'll likely have the best idea of which style is best for the work.
</li>
<li>
    b. It's your job to ensure that the team adheres to that style and the other systems in place
</li>
<li>
    4. you'll need to collaborate with other teams at the organization to meet the requirements based on project, scope, schedule, and budget.
</li>
<li>
    a. In other words, a project may affect not only your team, but other teams at an organization, as well as, say, the marketing or the finance team
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Working with cross-functional teams per documentation</h2>

<p>
    A cross-functional team includes team members (t-shaped professionals) who have different backgrounds, types of expertise, and job functions.
</p>
<p>
    Even though these team members have different skill sets, occupy different roles, and may even work in different departments, they are all working towards a common goal: the successful completion of your project.
</p>
<p>
    “T-shaped professionals” are skilled in how to collaborate and innovate with those in different job functions and across different departments, but they also contribute their own specific areas of expertise
</p>
    <p>
        Each member of a cross-functional team has their own unique perspective and experience, bringing different ideas and strategies to the project.
    </p>

<h3>Clarify Goals</h3>
<p>
    it is important to ensure that each member of the team understands their role, how they support each other, and the common goals of the project.
</p>
<p>
    It is vital to set clear goals for the team and make sure that the team understands those goals
</p>
<p>
    Be direct and concise, avoiding extraneous details and explanations.
</p>
<p>
    When communicating task or project goals, make sure you define key items, such as budget, deadlines, quality requirements, or important resources.
</p>
<p>
    Ensure your team members understand task and project goals by encouraging them to ask questions and clarify information
</p>

<h3>Get team members with the right skills</h3>

<p>
    Making sure you have team members with the correct skill sets for each of the project functions is critical.
</p>

<h3>Measure progress</h3>

<p>
    Showing your team how much they have accomplished helps keep them motivated
</p>
<p>
    You can measure progress in many ways, including meeting key milestones, completing project tasks, and meeting project goals on time and within budget.
</p>
<p>
    Ask them if they anticipate being finished on time. If not, ask how you can help them succeed.
</p>
<p>
    Keep track of the team’s progress throughout the project by documenting when tasks and goals are completed, and let your team members know if the project is on track or not.
</p>
<p>
    Make sure you communicate successes, delays, or issues, to the team so they know how the project is progressing.
</p>
<p>
    Keeping everyone informed is essential to the project’s success.
</p>

<h3>Recognize efforts</h3>
<p>
    it is your job to make sure that each member of your cross-functional team recognizes the value of their efforts each step of the way.
</p>
<p>
    Learning what makes your team members feel supported, giving and taking feedback, and being mindful of each individual's background, personal identifiers, and work style can help mediate some of the differences among team members.
