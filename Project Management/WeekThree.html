<h1> Week Three</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>We'll also cover the project management life cycle and phases, and you'll learn about the different styles, scenarios, and factors that can impact a project and its tasks at any given phase. When we're done, you'll be able to explain and follow the life cycle of a project, define and outline a project's phases, and each phase's tasks, compare different project management methodologies to determine which methodology is most effective for a project, and finally, organize how a project is run, according to different program management methodologies. </p>
<h2>Project life cycle</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        initiate the project
    </li>
    <li>
        make a plan
    </li>
    <li>
        execute and complete tasks
    </li>
    <li>
        close the project
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Initiate the project</h3>
<p>Launchpad for entire process of project</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        define project goals and deliverables(specific tasks or outcomes)
    </li>
    <li>
        identify the budget and resources(people, equipment, office space, programs) you'll need  put into project proposal
    </li>
    <li>
        the people involved in your project,
    </li>
    <li>
        any other details that can impact the successful completion of your project.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Questions to ask</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Who are the stakeholders?</li>
    <li>What are the client’s or customer’s goals?</li>
    <li>What is the purpose and mission of the project?</li>
    <li>What are the measurable objectives for the team?</li>
    <li>What is the project trying to improve? </li>
    <li>When does this project need to be completed? </li>
    <li>What skills and resources will the project require? </li>
    <li>What will the project cost? What are the benefits?</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll document all this information in one place to showcase the project's value, and hopefully get approval to move forward with it.</p>

<h3>Make a plan</h3>
<p>Essential and many ways to do it</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create budget</li>
    <li>Breakdown of tasks to complete</li>
    <li>Establish team</li>
    <li>Ways to communicate/determine team roles and responsibilities </li>
    <li>Set schedule</li>
    <li>Resources</li>
    <li>How to handle problems or changes in project (potential risks: Scheduling delays, budget changes, technology and software requirements, legal issues, quality control, and access to resources )</li>

</ul>
<p>(Lots more to include)</p>

<h3>Execute</h3>
<p>Project team has the job of completing the task</p>
<p>Primary task as the project manager is to monitor progress and keep team motivated </p>
<p>remove any obstacles that might come up so that the tasks are executed well and on time.</p>

<h3>Close the project</h3>
<p>Team has a moment to celebrate and evaluate how it went (what worked and didn't) </p>

<h2>The consequences of rushing through a project phase (per the documentation)</h2>
<p>Could make the plan fail before it starts</p>
<p>You should: communicate if you need more time to draft a response</p>
<p>Involve all key players in the decision that was asked for</p>

<h3>Takeaway from reading</h3>
<p>It may seem like a lot of work to go through an entire project life cycle, but the long-term impact it will have on your project is huge! It is your job as the project manager to make sure that your leadership truly understands the risk of not properly preparing for a project. Making assumptions that are incorrect can put your company at risk. Instead, taking the time to carefully initiate, plan, execute, and close your project leads to project success and good working relationships with customers. </p>

<h2>Methodologies</h2>
<h3>Linear</h3>
<p> Linear means the previous phase or task has to be completed before the next can start</p>
<p> Using this type of linear project management approach, completing each step in order and sticking to the agreed upon specific results and being able to deliver just what the client ordered.</p>
<p>Linear projects don't require many changes during development and have a clear sequential process</p>

<h3>Iterative</h3>
<p>Iterative means some of the phases and tasks will overlap or happen at the same time that other tasks are being worked on</p>
<p>Iterative projects allow for more flexibility and anticipate changes.</p>

<h3>Waterfall</h3>
<p>refers to the sequential ordering of phases, you complete one at a time down the line (has a linear approach)</p>
<p>use when: the phases of the project are clearly defined or when there are tasks to complete before another can begin, or when changes to the project are very expensive to implement once it's started</p>

<h3>Agile</h3>
<p>many tasks being worked on at the same time, or in various stages of completion which makes it an iterative approach. </p>
<p>Agile project phases overlap and tasks are completed in iterations, which in Scrum, are called sprints</p>
<p>Projects that are best suited for an Agile approach are those where the client has an idea of what they want but doesn't have a concrete picture in mind, or they have a set of qualities they'd like to see in the end result, but aren't as concerned with exactly what it looks like or a level of high uncertainty and risk involved with the project.</p>

<h3>Scrum</h3>
<p> an Agile framework that focuses on developing, delivering, and sustaining complex projects and products through collaboration, accountability, and an iterative process. Work is completed by small, cross-functional teams led by a Scrum Master and is divided into short Sprints with a set list of deliverables.</p>

<h3>Lean Six Sigma</h3>
<ul>
    <li>common in projects that have goals to save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly.</li>
    <li>focuses on team collaboration which promotes a positive work environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Phases (DMAIC)</p>
<ul>
    <li>Define</li>
    <li>Measure</li>
    <li>Analyze</li>
    <li>Improve</li>
    <li>Control</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>defining tells you what to measure, measuring tells you what to analyze, analyzing tells you what to improve, and improving tells you what to control</strong></p>

<p>DMAIC is a strategy for process improvement, meaning you're trying to figure out where the problems are in the current process and fix them so that everything runs more smoothly.</p>

<h4>Define</h4>
<p>define the project goal and talk to stakeholders about expectations for the project</p>

<h4>Measure</h4>
<p>map out the current process and locate exactly where the problems are and what kind of effect the problems have on the process</p>
<p>generate reports on a weekly, monthly, quarterly basis. In other situations, you might have employees or customers fill out surveys or look at inventory, shipping, and tracking records, things like that</p>

<h4>Analyze</h4>
<p>identify gaps and issues</p>

<h4>Improve</h4>
<p>modifying staffing to address company needs</p>

<h4>Control</h4>
<p>Controlling is all about learning from the work you did up front to put new processes and documentation in place and continue to monitor so the company doesn't revert back to the old, inefficient way of doing things</p>

<h3>Lean and Six Sigma methodologies (per the documentation)</h3>

<h4>Lean</h4>
<ul>


<li>The main principle in Lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation.  </li>
<li> By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, only value is added at each phase of production.</li>

</ul>

<p>Lean Manufacturing methodology recognizes eight types of waste within an operation: defects, excess processing, overproduction, waiting, inventory, transportation, motion, and non-utilized talent</p>

<p>In the manufacturing industry, these types of waste are often attributed to issues such as: </p>
<p>These same issues create waste in project management.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lack of proper documentation</li>
    <li>Lack of process standards</li>
    <li>Not understanding the customers’ needs</li>
    <li>Lack of effective communication</li>
    <li>Lack of process control</li>
    <li>Inefficient process design</li>
    <li>Failures of management</li>
</ul>

<p>Implement Lean project management when you want to use limited resources, reduce waste, and streamline processes to gain maximum benefits. </p>
<p>You can achieve this by using the pillars of the Lean 5S quality tool. </p>
<p>Implementing the 5S method means cleaning up and organizing the workplace to achieve the smallest amount of wasted time and material</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Sort:</strong> Remove all items not needed for current production operations and leave only the bare essentials. </li>
    <li><strong>Set in order:</strong> Arrange needed items so that they are easy to use. Label items so that anyone can find them or put them away.</li>
    <li><strong>Shine:</strong> Keep everything in the correct place. Clean your workspace every day.</li>
    <li><strong>Standardize:</strong> Perform the process in the same way every time.</li>
    <li><strong>Sustain:</strong> Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline in your team.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Kanban</h4>
<p>Kanban scheduling system or board, is a visualization tool that enables you to optimize the flow of your team’s work.</p>
<p>It gives the team a visual display to identify what needs to be done and when. The Kanban board uses cards that are moved from left to right to show progress and help your team coordinate the work. </p>
<p> is a tool used in both Agile and Lean approaches that provides visual feedback about the status of the work in progress through the use of Kanban boards or charts. With Kanban, project managers use sticky notes or note cards on a physical or digital Kanban board to represent the team’s tasks with categories like “To do,” “In progress,” and “Done.”</p>

<h4>Six Sigma</h4>
<p>Six Sigma is a methodology used to reduce variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time</p>

<ol>
    <li>Always focus on the customer.</li>
    <li>Identify and understand how the work gets done. Understand how work really happens.</li>
    <li>Make your processes flow smoothly.</li>
    <li>Reduce waste and concentrate on value.</li>
    <li>Stop defects by removing variation.</li>
    <li>Involve and collaborate with your team.</li>
    <li>Approach improvement activity in a systematic way.</li>
</ol>

<p>Use this methodology to find aspects of the product or process that are measurable like time, cost, or quantity. Then inspect that measurable item and reject any products that do not meet the Six Sigma standard. Any process that created unacceptable products has to be improved upon.  </p>

<h4>Lean Six Sigma</h4>
<p>is a combination of Lean and Six Sigma approaches. It is often used in projects that aim to save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly. Lean Six Sigma is also ideal for solving complex or high-risk problems. The 5S organization framework, the DMAIC process, and the use of Kanban boards are all components of this approach. </p>

<h3>Common project management approaches and how to select one (per documentation)</h3>
<p>Practice and what's best for both the project and the team.</p>

<h3>Overview of Classic and Matrix structures</h3>
<p>Organizational structure refers to the way a company or organization is arranged or structured</p>
<p>This structure also tells you how job tasks are divided and coordinated and how all the different members of the organization relate to one another (who reports to who)</p>


<h4> Classic</h4>
<p>"functional" or "top-down" structures</p>
<p>The Classic grouping follows a typical chain of command where the Chief Executive Officer, also known as CEO, and other executives are at the top, followed by directors or managers, then their direct reports and so on. Each of these directors or managers typically oversee teams within their function of the organization, like marketing, sales, or human resources.</p>
<p>Classic organizations are also referred to as functional organizations because the organization is divided into departments based on function. </p>

<h4> Matrix</h4>
<p> the Matrix structure has direct higher-ups to report to and stakeholders from other departments or programs</p>
<p>a Matrix structure as a grid where you still have people above you, but you also have people in adjacent departments who expect to hear updates on your work progress</p>


<h3>A project manager's role within different organizational structures (per the documentation)</h3>

<p>If you are a project manager in this (Classic) type of structure, you may need to consult with functional managers to understand your resources and the capacity of each teammate, as well as to familiarize yourself with each function’s internal processes and approval structure. Your authority may be slightly limited due to competing priorities, approval chains, and other complexities, but setting expectations up front will enable you to navigate the organization and execute your project successfully.</p>

<p>As a project manager in a Matrix organization, a team will essentially have at least two chains of command, or managers</p>

<h3>How organizational structure impacts project management</h3>

<p>An organization's structure provides the framework for accountability and communication.</p>
<p>One way organizational structure can impact the way you manage a project is by the amount of authority given to the project manager. </p>
<p>Authority has to do with your ability to make decisions for the project that impact the organization.</p>
<p>Another way organizational structures can impact project management is through resource availability. Managing a project is a lot easier when you know how to access the people, equipment, and budget that you need.</p>
