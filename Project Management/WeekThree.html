<h1> Week Three</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>We'll also cover the project management life cycle and phases, and you'll learn about the different styles, scenarios, and factors that can impact a project and its tasks at any given phase. When we're done, you'll be able to explain and follow the life cycle of a project, define and outline a project's phases, and each phase's tasks, compare different project management methodologies to determine which methodology is most effective for a project, and finally, organize how a project is run, according to different program management methodologies. </p>
<h2>Project life cycle</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        initiate the project
    </li>
    <li>
        make a plan
    </li>
    <li>
        execute and complete tasks
    </li>
    <li>
        close the project
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Initiate the project</h3>
<p>Launchpad for entire process of project</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        define project goals and deliverables(specific tasks or outcomes)
    </li>
    <li>
        identify the budget and resources(people, equipment, office space, programs) you'll need  put into project proposal
    </li>
    <li>
        the people involved in your project,
    </li>
    <li>
        any other details that can impact the successful completion of your project.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>You'll document all this information in one place to showcase the project's value, and hopefully get approval to move forward with it.</p>

<h3>Make a plan</h3>
<p>Essential and many ways to do it</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create budget</li>
    <li>Breakdown of tasks to complete</li>
    <li>Establish team</li>
    <li>Ways to communicate/determine team roles and responsibilities </li>
    <li>Set schedule</li>
    <li>Resources</li>
    <li>How to handle problems or changes in project (potential risks: Scheduling delays, budget changes, technology and software requirements, legal issues, quality control, and access to resources )</li>

</ul>
<p>(Lots more to include)</p>

<h3>Execute</h3>
<p>Project team has the job of completing the task</p>
<p>Primary task as the project manager is to monitor progress and keep team motivated </p>
<p>remove any obstacles that might come up so that the tasks are executed well and on time.</p>

<h3>Close the project</h3>
<p>Team has a moment to celebrate and evaluate how it went (what worked and didn't) </p>

<h2>The consequences of rushing through a project phase (per the documentation)</h2>
<p>Could make the plan fail befoee it starts</p>
<p>You should: communicate if you need more time to draft a response</p>
<p>Involve all key players in the decision that was asked for</p>

<h3>Takeaway from reading</h3>
<p>It may seem like a lot of work to go through an entire project life cycle, but the long-term impact it will have on your project is huge! It is your job as the project manager to make sure that your leadership truly understands the risk of not properly preparing for a project. Making assumptions that are incorrect can put your company at risk. Instead, taking the time to carefully initiate, plan, execute, and close your project leads to project success and good working relationships with customers. </p>
