<h1> Week Three</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>We'll also cover the project management life cycle and phases, and you'll learn about the different styles, scenarios, and factors that can impact a project and its tasks at any given phase. When we're done, you'll be able to explain and follow the life cycle of a project, define and outline a project's phases, and each phase's tasks, compare different project management methodologies to determine which methodology is most effective for a project, and finally, organize how a project is run, according to different program management methodologies. </p>
<h2>Project life cycle</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        initiate the project
    </li>
    <li>
        make a plan
    </li>
    <li>
        execute and complete tasks
    </li>
    <li>
        close the project
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Initiate the project</h3>
<p>Launchpad for entire process of project</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        define project goals and deliverables(specific tasks or outcomes)
    </li>
    <li>
        identify the budget and resources(people, equipment, office space, programs) you'll need  put into project proposal
    </li>
    <li>
        the people involved in your project,
    </li>
    <li>
        any other details that can impact the successful completion of your project.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Questions to ask</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Who are the stakeholders?</li>
    <li>What are the client’s or customer’s goals?</li>
    <li>What is the purpose and mission of the project?</li>
    <li>What are the measurable objectives for the team?</li>
    <li>What is the project trying to improve? </li>
    <li>When does this project need to be completed? </li>
    <li>What skills and resources will the project require? </li>
    <li>What will the project cost? What are the benefits?</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll document all this information in one place to showcase the project's value, and hopefully get approval to move forward with it.</p>

<h3>Make a plan</h3>
<p>Essential and many ways to do it</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create budget</li>
    <li>Breakdown of tasks to complete</li>
    <li>Establish team</li>
    <li>Ways to communicate/determine team roles and responsibilities </li>
    <li>Set schedule</li>
    <li>Resources</li>
    <li>How to handle problems or changes in project (potential risks: Scheduling delays, budget changes, technology and software requirements, legal issues, quality control, and access to resources )</li>

</ul>
<p>(Lots more to include)</p>

<h3>Execute</h3>
<p>Project team has the job of completing the task</p>
<p>Primary task as the project manager is to monitor progress and keep team motivated </p>
<p>remove any obstacles that might come up so that the tasks are executed well and on time.</p>

<h3>Close the project</h3>
<p>Team has a moment to celebrate and evaluate how it went (what worked and didn't) </p>

<h2>The consequences of rushing through a project phase (per the documentation)</h2>
<p>Could make the plan fail before it starts</p>
<p>You should: communicate if you need more time to draft a response</p>
<p>Involve all key players in the decision that was asked for</p>

<h3>Takeaway from reading</h3>
<p>It may seem like a lot of work to go through an entire project life cycle, but the long-term impact it will have on your project is huge! It is your job as the project manager to make sure that your leadership truly understands the risk of not properly preparing for a project. Making assumptions that are incorrect can put your company at risk. Instead, taking the time to carefully initiate, plan, execute, and close your project leads to project success and good working relationships with customers. </p>

<h2>Methodologies</h2>
<h3>Linear</h3>
<p> Linear means the previous phase or task has to be completed before the next can start</p>
<p> Using this type of linear project management approach, completing each step in order and sticking to the agreed upon specific results and being able to deliver just what the client ordered.</p>
<p>Linear projects don't require many changes during development and have a clear sequential process</p>

<h3>Iterative</h3>
<p>Iterative means some of the phases and tasks will overlap or happen at the same time that other tasks are being worked on</p>
<p>Iterative projects allow for more flexibility and anticipate changes.</p>

<h3>Waterfall</h3>
<p>refers to the sequential ordering of phases, you complete one at a time down the line (has a linear approach)</p>
<p>use when: the phases of the project are clearly defined or when there are tasks to complete before another can begin, or when changes to the project are very expensive to implement once it's started</p>

<h3>Agile</h3>
<p>many tasks being worked on at the same time, or in various stages of completion which makes it an iterative approach. </p>
<p>Agile project phases overlap and tasks are completed in iterations, which in Scrum, are called sprints</p>
<p>Projects that are best suited for an Agile approach are those where the client has an idea of what they want but doesn't have a concrete picture in mind, or they have a set of qualities they'd like to see in the end result, but aren't as concerned with exactly what it looks like or a level of high uncertainty and risk involved with the project.</p>

<h3>Lean Six Sigma</h3>
<ul>
    <li>common in projects that have goals to save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly.</li>
    <li>focuses on team collaboration which promotes a positive work environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Phases (DMAIC)</p>
<ul>
    <li>Define</li>
    <li>Measure</li>
    <li>Analyze</li>
    <li>Improve</li>
    <li>Control</li>
</ul>
